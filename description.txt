[i:109] Features

[i:75] "Hook" any arbitrary method you want easily:
On.Terraria.Player.CheckMana += (...) => {...}

[i:75] Use "hooks" to detect when a method runs, change how it runs or even replace it.
"Hooks" are automatically undone whenever your mod unloads. This is handled by TerrariaHooks for you.

[i:75] Manipulate any method at runtime via IL... += (...) => {...}
Special thanks to Chicken-Bones for the great discussions!

[i:75] Use RuntimeDetour to quickly port your existing "method swapping" code.
Note that this requires you to undo your detours on unload.
