TerrariaHooks: The power of HookGen in the palm of your hands.
‍
Players: This mod is needed by other mods. Just install it, it doesn't change Terraria on its own.
‍
Modders: Please read the MonoMod RuntimeDetour README, which also explains HookGen:

‍
The main features of TerrariaHooks:
‍
- "Hook" any arbitrary method you want easily:
On.Terraria.Player.CheckMana += (...) => {...}
‍
- Use "hooks" to detect when a method runs, change how it runs or even replace it.
"Hooks" are automatically undone whenever your mod unloads. This is handled by TerrariaHooks for you.
‍
- Manipulate any method at runtime via IL... += (...) => {...} using Cecil and many helpers.
Special thanks to Chicken-Bones for the great ideas and feedback along the way!
‍
- Use RuntimeDetour to quickly port your existing "method swapping" code.
Note that this requires you to undo your detours on unload.
